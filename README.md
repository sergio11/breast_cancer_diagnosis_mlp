# Breast Cancer Diagnosis with MLP 🩺💻

This project utilizes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network implemented with scikit-learn to perform breast cancer diagnosis based on tumor characteristics extracted from biopsy samples. The MLP model is trained on a dataset containing various features derived from digital images of breast tissue samples, such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

## Purpose 🎯

The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable system for diagnosing breast cancer based on quantitative analysis of cell nuclei characteristics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically MLP neural networks, we aim to create a predictive model capable of classifying tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) with high accuracy. Early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely treatment and intervention.

This dataset is a copy of the UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets. [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).

The input features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

The separation plane described above was obtained using the Multiple Surface Method Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Constructing a Decision Tree by Linear Programming". Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method that uses linear programming to build a decision tree. Relevant features were selected through an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separation planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separation plane in the three-dimensional space is described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
