# Breast Cancer Diagnosis with MLP ü©∫üíª

This project utilizes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network implemented with scikit-learn to perform breast cancer diagnosis based on tumor characteristics extracted from biopsy samples. The MLP model is trained on a dataset containing various features derived from digital images of breast tissue samples, such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

## Purpose üéØ

The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable system for diagnosing breast cancer based on quantitative analysis of cell nuclei characteristics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically MLP neural networks, we aim to create a predictive model capable of classifying tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) with high accuracy. Early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely treatment and intervention.

## Key Features üîë

- Utilizes an MLP neural network for breast cancer diagnosis.
- Preprocesses input data using feature scaling with StandardScaler.
- Implements training and evaluation functionalities.
- Provides prediction capabilities for new biopsy samples.
- Offers detailed model evaluation metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Supports easy integration into Python applications for breast cancer diagnosis tasks.

## Dataset üìä

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, available in scikit-learn's built-in datasets module. It consists of features computed from digital images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. Each feature represents various characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images. The dataset contains both malignant and benign tumor samples, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

## Usage üöÄ

1. **Training the Model**: The model is trained using the `fit` method, which loads the dataset, preprocesses the input features, and trains the MLP classifier.

2. **Making Predictions**: After training, the model can be used to make predictions on new biopsy samples using the `predict` method. The input data should be provided in a specific format, including features such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, etc.

3. **Evaluation**: The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrix, to assess its diagnostic capabilities.
